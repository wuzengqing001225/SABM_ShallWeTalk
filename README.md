# SABM: Shall We Talk

![Workflow](https://github.com/wuzengqing001225/SABM_ShallWeTalk/blob/main/IMG/workflow.png?raw=true)

This repository is the source code for our paper "Shall We Talk: Exploring Spontaneous Collaborations of Competing LLM Agents." In this work, we investigate whether LLM-empowered agents can achieve *spontaneous cooperation in a competitive environment* and explore its patterns through interdisciplinary case studies, including the **Keynesian Beauty Contest** (Game Theory), **Bertrand Competition** (Economics), and **Emergency Evacuation** (Behavioral Science).

This work is realized based on a novel Agent-Based Modeling framework we proposed: Smart Agent-Based Modeling (SABM).
**[Smart Agent-Based Modeling: On the Use of Large Language Models in Computer Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06330)**.
