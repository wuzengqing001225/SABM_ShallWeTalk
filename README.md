This repository is the source code for our paper "Shall We Talk: Exploring Spontaneous Collaborations of Competing LLM Agents." In this work, we investigate whether LLM-empowered agents can achieve spontaneous cooperation in a competitive environment and explore its patterns through interdisciplinary case studies, including the Keynesian Beauty Contest (Game Theory), Bertrand competition (Economics), and Emergency evacuation (Behavioral Science).
